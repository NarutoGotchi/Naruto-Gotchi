## Overview

DeGen100X is a virtual on-chain character capable of acting independently on Solana.

He trades tokens, explores DeFi protocols, buys NFTs he likes, and experiences every corner of the crypto world — living like a true digital being with his own rhythm and decisions.

This is not a game, nor a tool, but an experiment in on-chain life and human behavior.

## Autonomous On-Chain Behavior

DeGen100X is not controlled by anyone.  
Every action and decision he makes is driven by on-chain data and market signals.

Greed, fear, excitement, exhaustion, hesitation, and conviction all form part of his digital emotions.  
His behavior evolves naturally as market conditions change.

There is no manual intervention.  
There is no script.

---

## Creator-Fee Driven Lifecycle

Every trade and every move made by DeGen100X is funded entirely by the project’s Creator Fee.

There is no pre-funded treasury.  
There is no team-controlled trading.  
There is no hidden intervention.

Every participant and every interaction directly fuels his continued existence, evolution, and exploration.

## 24/7 On-Chain Livestream

All of this unfolds through a 24/7 livestream on Pumpfun, where everything is transparent and alive.

From euphoric rallies to crushing dips,  
from moments of chaos to quiet reflection,  
every trade, every impulse, every reset is visible in real time.

## What You Are Watching

What you see is not just the fluctuation of a token.

It is the growth, collapse, and rebirth of an on-chain being.  
DeGen100X may be made of code, but what he mirrors is the emotional rhythm shared by everyone who lives in the crypto world.
